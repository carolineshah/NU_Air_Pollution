**Project Description:**
We are interested in exploring whether there is a correlation between the number of air pollution complaints across neighborhoods in Chicago and socioeconomic (i.e., per capita income) and demographic factors (i.e., presence of minority communities). We consult three different datasets to extract environmental complaints during CY2010 and triangulate this information with neighborhood socioeconomic and demographic data from the same time period.

**Research Questions:**
1. Which Chicago neighborhoods submitted the highest number of air pollution complaints in 2010?
2. Did the number of air pollution complaints vary by neighborhood income level?
3. Did the number of air pollution complaints vary by the presence of minority communities?

**Datasets:**
1. Chicago Data Portal - Environmental Complaints: provides types and details of air pollution complaints during CY2010 by street address.
2. Chicago Data Portal - Socioeconomic Indicators of Public Health:  provides poverty, unemployment, and income demographics by neighborhood from years 2008-2012.
3. CMAP 2010 Census Data - Summarized to Chicago Community Area: provides race, gender, housing demographics by neighborhood.
